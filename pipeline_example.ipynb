       " \"Question: Is this item a shampoo with a dispenser pump head? Answer: No, the image and product description clearly indicate this is Himalaya Baby Powder, not a shampoo.  It comes in a large bottle, but it's talcum powder, not a liquid, so it wouldn't have a pump dispenser.\",\n",
       " 'Question: Is this item a shampoo with a dispenser pump head? Answer: No, this item is not a shampoo. The product description clearly states it is a \"Mosquito Repellent Refill Liquid\". Despite having a dispenser pump head similar to some shampoos or lotions, its intended use is to repel mosquitoes.  The inclusion in the \"toys & baby products\" and \"Baby Bath, Skin & Grooming\" categories is likely due to its relevance to protecting babies from mosquito bites, not because it is a bath or grooming product itself.',\n",
       " 'Question: Is this item a shampoo with a dispenser pump head? Answer: No, the items pictured and described in the row data are not shampoo. They are a baby lotion with a pump dispenser and a bottle of baby powder. The row data explicitly states \"Himalaya Extra Moisturizing Baby Lotion\" and \"Baby Powder\".  Shampoo is not mentioned anywhere.',\n",
       " 'Question: Is this item a shampoo with a dispenser pump head? Answer: No, this item is not a shampoo with a dispenser pump head. Picture Analysis: The picture shows a halved coconut shell (likely treated/painted black inside), some black bangles, white beaded jewelry, and some twine. These items are traditionally used in some South Asian cultures for newborn baby care and spiritual practices.  There\\'s no sign of any shampoo bottle or pump. Row Data Analysis: The product name \"Malli Spiritual : New Born Baby Care - Vengai Pottu/Karu Valayal/Paal Pasi/Erukkan Arainganan kodi (set of 4)\" translates roughly to newborn baby care items with spiritual significance.  The terms refer to specific traditional items: Vengai Pottu (neem leaf markings), Karu Valayal (black bangles), Paal Pasi (milk-related ritual), and Erukkan Arainganan kodi (a type of string). None of these suggest shampoo or a modern dispenser. The categorization under \"Baby Bath, Skin & Grooming\" is broad and doesn\\'t necessarily imply shampoo.Therefore, the item is a set of traditional newborn baby care items with spiritual significance and not a shampoo.',\n",
